# Source Tech LTD: Team, Project, and Attendance System

This is a web-based application developed for Source Tech LTD in partnership with BAE Systems. The system is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for team management, project tracking, and attendance monitoring. It is developed using the latest web technologies and follows best practices for software development.

## Getting Started

### Starting the Localhost Server

In order to run the application locally, you will need to start a localhost server. You can use a web server like MAMP, WAMP, or XAMPP, depending on your operating system. Follow the instructions for your chosen web server to start the localhost server.

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `localhost` with the specified port number (e.g., `http://localhost:8888`). You should see the login page for the application.

### Importing the Database

After starting the server, you will need to import the provided `Source_Tech.sql` database file into your PHPMyAdmin.

1. Open PHPMyAdmin in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8888/phpmyadmin`).
2. Create a new database with the name `Source_Tech`.
3. Select the `Source_Tech` database, and then click on the `Import` tab.
4. Click on the `Choose File` button, and select the `Source_Tech.sql` file from your project folder.
5. Click on the `Go` button to start the import process. Once the import is complete, the database will be set up and ready for use with the application.
